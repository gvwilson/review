<h1>Beautiful Reviews</h1>
<p>In the award-winning book <em><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-code/9780596510046/">Beautiful Code</a></em>,
three dozen of the world's best programmers described
one of the most beautiful pieces of software they had ever seen
and explained what made it exceptional.
By doing so,
they gave others a chance to see the world through their eyes
and understand how they interpreted and applied general rules of design.</p>
<p>The <em>Beautiful Reviews</em> project will do the same thing with an important twist:
instead of explaining and critiquing their own code,
each contributor will present an in-depth review of something
that someone else designed and wrote.
These reviews,
and the dialog between the creators and reviewers,
will help us understand how experienced programmers think about their craft,
show us how to do better reviews ourselves,
and provide a reference against which to evaluate machine-generated reviews.</p>
